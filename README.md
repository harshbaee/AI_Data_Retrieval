AI Data Retrieval
AI Data Retrieval is a Python-based application that uses Streamlit for the front-end interface, SerpAPI for web search functionality, and OpenAI GPT to analyze and retrieve relevant data from the web. It supports searching for companies, financial information, market trends, and more, based on various customizable queries.

Features
Web search with SerpAPI.
AI-powered data analysis using OpenAI GPT.
Real-time data retrieval for multiple industries (e.g., Health Care, Financials, Technology).
Streamlit-based interface for a user-friendly experience.
Ability to filter data based on industry sectors.
Installation
Step 1: Clone the repository
Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/AI_Data_Retrieval.git
cd AI_Data_Retrieval
Step 2: Install dependencies
Create a virtual environment (this helps to keep dependencies isolated from other projects) and install all required dependencies:

Create a virtual environment (if you're using venv):

On Windows:

bash
Copy code
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\activate
On Mac/Linux:

bash
Copy code
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
Install dependencies: Once the virtual environment is activated, install the required Python dependencies from requirements.txt:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
This will install all the libraries needed for the app to work (such as streamlit, openai, serpapi, etc.).

Step 3: Configure API Keys
Make sure you have the required API keys and configuration files.

Set up environment variables:

Create a .env file in the root of the project directory (the same folder as your app.py file).

Inside the .env file, add your API keys like so:

plaintext
Copy code
SERPAPI_KEY=your_serpapi_key
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
Google Sheets Integration (optional):

If you're integrating with Google Sheets, follow these steps:

Download the Google Service Account JSON from the Google Developer Console.
Place the downloaded file in your project directory.
Update your code to point to the path of this JSON file if needed.
Step 4: Run the App
After the dependencies are installed and the API keys are set up, you can start the app:

Make sure you're in your virtual environment.

To run the Streamlit app, use the following command:

bash
Copy code
streamlit run app.py
This will start the Streamlit server and open the app in your browser.

Usage
Once the app is running, you'll be able to:

Select the industry/sector you want to search for (e.g., Health Care, Technology).
Enter your custom query for the search.
The app will retrieve the relevant data based on your query and display the results.
Troubleshooting
If the process "goes out" of the expected steps after installing dependencies, here are some things to check:

Ensure you're in the correct folder by running:

bash
Copy code
cd AI_Data_Retrieval
If your terminal is still in the wrong directory, you might have navigated out of the project folder. Recheck the directory you're in with pwd (on Mac/Linux) or cd (on Windows).
